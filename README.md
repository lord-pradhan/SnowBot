# SnowBot

SnowBot is an autonomous snow-clearing mobile robot that won Best Project Overall at MechE Design Expo 2019 at Carnegie Mellon University. The final [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlkrziDI0P4 "demo") shows SnowBot successfully localizing itself using inexpensive UWB beacons, and covering a user-defined area while executing dump manouvers to get rid of the snow at designated 'dump zones'. The only user input provided is the target area, and dump zone definition. 

This repository houses the autonomy stack and Arduino firmware that goes into making SnowBot autonomous. The autonomy stack was developed in Python3 and deployed on a Raspi 4, while the low-level firmware was deployed on three different Arduinos.
